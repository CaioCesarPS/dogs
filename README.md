# Requirements

- Docker with docker-compose
- If you want to run the tests: NodeJS >= 20.19.0 (recommended to use 22.20.0)

# How to run

- Clone the repository
- Run `docker-compose up -d --build app frontend`
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

# Optional Enchanchements

- [x] Add Docker support
- [x] Add unit or integration tests
- [x] Use Tailwind or other CSS frameworks for styling
- [x] Add caching of API results in the backend
- [x] Add CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [x] Deploy the project (e.g., Vercel, Render, Netlify)

# Observations

1- The CI/CD I created my own custom, it's located inside the webhook folder.

2- The project is deployed on my personal server, so I can't share the link here. But I can show if needed.
